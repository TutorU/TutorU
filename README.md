# TutorU

## Description
TutorU connects students to tutors in an easy and innovative way. Students can request help from a tutor on-demand and if a tutor is nearby, they can accept and help the student.

## Core User Stories
* Users (both students & tutors) need a profile.
* Requesting a tutor can only be done in specific areas (i.e. UCSD Campus)

- Students
  * Students can request a tutor for a specific subject they need help with.
  * Students can choose a tutor to get help from if multiple tutors accept the request.
  * Students can rate the tutor after getting help

- Tutors
  * To be a tutor for a certain subject, a user must submit their transcript so we can verify their credibility for the subject they want to be a tutor for.
  * Once a student has submitted a request for help, tutors that are verified for the subject that the student needs help in can view the request and choose to accept or ignore the request from the student.
  * Tutors can rate students after an interaction.

## Optional User Stories (nice to have)
* Students can schedule a tutor for help that they like.
* Students can get free tutor sessions
* Tutors can be ranked based on their average ratings from students.
* Tutors can make more money based on their rank.
* Students can pay the tutor - through the app.
